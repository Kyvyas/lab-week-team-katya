# lab-week-team-katya

We decided to go on with building a virtual assistant application that can record your tasks for you. 
The brainstorming session we had led us to think about more ideas and we realised that we can incorporate many of the skills that we picked up since week 1.

We went on to scripting the user stories and we decided on the following:

> **USER STORIES:**

> 1. As a user
So that I can use the service
I would like to enter my details

> 2.  As a user
So that i can keep track of my tasks
I would like to store my tasks online

> 3. As a user
So that I know what I am doing
I would like to be reminded of my tasks

> 4. As a user
So that I can organise my tasks
I would like to be able to add tags to them

> 5. As a user
So that i know when important dates occur
I would like to view them on a calendar

> 6. As a user
So that I donâ€™t plan a journey on a stormy day
I would like to be able to check the weather.
> - Use inheritance to use the instance variables and methods created by parent class for new uses.
